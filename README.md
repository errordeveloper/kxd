# Kubernetes on Docker for Mac

> Please note, this project is work in progress.

> Also note, there exists a known issue (see [docker/for-mac#1305](https://github.com/docker/for-mac/issues/1305) & [docker/for-mac#1176](https://github.com/docker/for-mac/issues/1176)), where a crash may occur when some sufficiently large payload is deployed onto Kubernetes. A known work-around is to ensure Docker for Mac has only one vCPU.

```bash
git clone https://github.com/errordeveloper/kxd
cd kxd
./start.sh
```

Kubernetes API is now available on `localhost:8080` and doesn't require `kubeconfig`.

```console
> kubectl -s localhost:8080 cluster-info
Kubernetes master is running at localhost:8080
KubeDNS is running at localhost:8080/api/v1/proxy/namespaces/kube-system/services/kube-dns

To further debug and diagnose cluster problems, use 'kubectl cluster-info dump'.

> kubectl -s localhost:8080 get nodes
NAME      STATUS         AGE
moby      Ready,master   2m
```

Next, let's make cluster DNS accessible from the Mac:
```
./proxy-service.sh --namespace kube-system kube-dns
```

Kubernetes DNS server is now directly accessible via it's service IP:
```
> dig kubernetes.default.svc.cluster.local @10.96.0.10

; <<>> DiG 9.8.3-P1 <<>> kubernetes.default.svc.cluster.local @10.96.0.10

```

To make any service IP available on the Mac, run `./proxy-service.sh [--namespace <namespace>] <name>`.
